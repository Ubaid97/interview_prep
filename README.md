## Agile and Scrum
### What is agile – 
Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development. Instead of trying to develop the complete product before testing and releasing it, in agile testing happens in parallel to development. So small features are added, then tested, and then further features are added and tested, and so on. And the product is released incrementally as opposed to all at once, allowing the development team to get feedback after each increment release, including changes to the requirements, and adapt to them in the next increment or iteration.

### What is scrum – 
Scrum is a framework used to manage product development. It helps with time and task management when developing a product, by providing techniques to break down large tasks into smaller ones, to keep track of which requirements have been fulfilled, which are currently being worked, and which need to be worked on and in what time frame. 
I have consistently employed scrum tools and techniques during my training with sparta global. The objectives of the entire training programme are broken down into weekly requirements, and using trello we keep track of which tasks we need to complete during the week, which tasks we’re working on now and which we have already completed. 

### Difference between agile and scrum – 
Agile consists of a set of values and principles, like iterative and incremental development, to be applied in product development, scrum is a set of tools and techniques used to apply agile. Agile will be the reason why a team working on a project decide to design-develop-test a product in incremental cycles, and scrum is what they might use for task and time management during the project.

### 3 amigos – 
The three amigos in agile are three perspectives from which to examine an increment of work before, during, and after development. It’s important that the members taking up each of these perspectives collaborate with one another so that the work can achieve the acceptance criteria

**Business** – what problem are we trying to solve?

**Development** – how might we build a solution to solve that problem?

**Testing** – what would happen if this occurred?

The business perspective aims to identify the requirements the product needs to satisfy. The development perspective looks for ways to build solutions that will satisfy those requirements. The testing eye will examine whether the developed product behaves in accordance with the requirements

### Scrum roles –
The different roles involved in a project applying scrum framework:

**Scrum master** – works with the scrum team to ensure proper workflow, and that the sprints get completed in time. Also ensures transparency during scrum meetings, making sure all issues are mentioned and addressed

**Product owner** – works with end-users and customers to specify the proper requirements to give the scrum team

**Scrum team** – members of the scrum team, developing the product. Responsible for delivering high quality work

### Scrum artefacts –
Scrum artefacts are specifically designed to maximise transparency of key information so that everyone has the same understanding of the project requirements and progression

**Product backlog** – list of all the requirements the developed product needs to fulfil

**Sprint backlog** – list of requirements the scrum team specifies as its objective to fulfil by the end of a sprint

**Increment** – the team must have a product increment that is potentially releasable at the end of every sprint

### Scrum ceremonies – 
Scrum ceremonies are events that make up the cycle of a sprint:

**Sprint planning** – meeting held by the start of a sprint to determine the objectives of that sprint/ the requirements to be fulfilled 

**Daily stand-up** - daily review to ensure transparency. Members share what they've been working on and any troubles they may have encountered

**Sprint review** – meeting at the end of a sprint where the scrum team discuss the product at the end of the sprint and evaluate it in light of the requirements set in the sprint planning

**Sprint retrospective** – looking at how the team worked, any issues they encountered, any improvements to be made

### Difference between waterfall and agile –
In waterfall, the project team designs and develops the product as a whole, seeking to meet all requirements prior to testing the completed product and then releasing at the end. In agile, by contrast, testing occurs in parallel with development. The team doesn’t try to develop the product to meet all the requirements before testing, but instead works in incremental design-develop-test cycles. From the overall requirements, a subset is selected, and the product is developed to meet those requirements. This increment of the product is then tested before being released. The team moves on to the net cycle and continues to work on small increments of the product until all requirements are met. And as the increments are released, the development team adapt their work based on changing requirements due to feedback from stakeholders and users on previous increments. These differences mean that agile is more flexible than waterfall in terms of scope for allowing changes to requirements during development, and also makes it more responsive to feedback from end-users
Waterfall is useful in projects with a strict timeline and where the requirements are guaranteed not to change. In waterfall, requirement changes would mean a return to the design stage, whereas in agile the changes are simply integrated into the next cycle/increment.


## SQL
### What is a foreign key – 
Foreign keys are used to link tables. The foreign key of table B will be the primary key of table A, and specifying a column as a foreign key ensures that the column in question has the same data in both tables

### DDL, DQL, DML, DCL –
SQL commands are usually categorised into 4 main categories:

**DDL** – Data Definition Language consists of commands used to define a database:

CREATE – used to create a database or its objects

ALTER - used to alter the structure of the database

DROP – used to delete objects from the database

TRUNCATE – used to remove all records from a table


**DQL** – Data Query Language is used to run queries:

SELECT- used to retrieve data from the database


**DML** – Data Manipulation Language refers to commands used to manipulate data in a database:

INSERT – used to insert data into a table

UPDATE – used to update existing data in a table

DELETE – used to delete records in a table


**DCL** – Data Control Language is the commands that deal with the rights and permission of a database system:

GRANT – gives user access privileges to a database

REVOKE – revokes a user’s access privileges to a database


## OOP
### What is OOP - 
OOP is a programming model that organises software design around objects that contain data and functions and which can be used and manipulated according to various needs. Instead pf focusing on precedures, it will look at defining classes that contain attributes and functions which can then be called and executed when an instance of the class is created. I have used OOP for a number of tasks during the course of my trainijg, for instancr when creating a calculator class than contains functions for performing arithemtic operations. I created a class that contained functions that take in arguments for add, subtract, multiply and divide, and created an instance of that class outside of it. then, using the instance of the class, I called the functions inside of it by passing in parameters on which the functions performed their respective operations.

### 4 pillars
**Encapsulation** - refers to the private state of each object. An object will hold data and functions inside a class, but other objects do not have permission to access that class or make chnages to it, they're only call public functions (called methods).

**Abstraction** - applying abstraction is to make objects show only those features that are relevant for use by other objects, and hide the more complicated implementation code contained in each class. For instance, an object will show its public attributes and functions but not the code used to implement them. This makes it easier to communicate with objects.

**Inheritance** - sometimes objects are very similar with only slight differences, and it's important to avoid code repetition. So to reduce complexity and increase reusability, objects which share attributes and methods with other objects can inherit from them. the inherting class is the child class whilst the class being inherited from is the parent class. This allows objects to gain attributes and methods without having to implement the code for them again

**Polymorphism** - Objects can take on more than one form depending on the context. The program will determine which meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object, cutting down the need to duplicate code.

### TDD -
Test Driven Development is an approach to development which implements testing first, and then implements code to pass the test. This structures the programming process by having tests for specific functionalities, which provides an orientation for the developer in terms of what functionalities their next piece of code should implement. I have used TDD when implementing a class containing functions performing different arithemtic operations. I first created a test class with a test for the add function (yet to be implemented). I then went about implementing the add function so that it can pass the test. once the code was able to pass the test, I moved on to writing a test for the subtract function, before writing code to pass that test, and so on.
